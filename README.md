Iterarion 1:

Our group is working on a interactive storyboard like game. This game will develop a character and periodically present events to the player. These events will result in minigames or battling monster. Right now, we have worked on developing the initial battle/minigames along with a basic storyline.

Teddy: I worked on developing a player class to initiate the game. I also worked on one of our current minigames. I made up a dice like minigame similar to liars dice. In this, a CPU presents sum of dice rolls to the player. This sum is either a lie, or it is accurate. It is up to the player to decide. If the player is right, the cpu loses a die, if not the human loses a life out of 3. The game runs until either the player runs out of lives or the cpu runs out of dice.
